# WebScraping
A simple project to learn Webscraping using Python and BeautifulSoap

1. The page we are scrapping is https://www.newegg.com and search for video cards.

The final webink to scrap is https://www.newegg.com/Video-Cards-Video-Devices/Category/ID-38?Tpk=video%20cards

Run the file Web_Scrapper.py and it will create a csv file product.csv in the same folder.
